# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

- **Showing empathy** towards other community members
- **Using welcoming and inclusive language**

- **Spamming issues or pull requests** with irrelevant content

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

### Where This Applies
- **GitHub repository** (issues, pull requests, discussions, wiki)
- **Project documentation** and related websites
- **Community forums** and chat channels
- **Conferences and meetups** where the project is represented
- **Social media** when representing the project
- **Email communications** related to the project

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [conduct@your-domain.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Reporting Guidelines

When reporting an incident, please include:
- **Your contact information** (so we can follow up with you)
- **Names of individuals involved** (including witnesses, if any)
- **Description of the incident** and what happened
- **Date and time** of the incident
- **Location** where the incident occurred (GitHub issue, PR, etc.)
- **Any additional context** that might be helpful

### What to Expect
- **Acknowledgment** of your report within 24 hours
- **Investigation** conducted fairly and thoroughly
- **Regular updates** on the status of your report
- **Confidentiality** maintained throughout the process
- **Follow-up** to ensure the issue is resolved

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been unfairly accused or sanctioned, you may appeal the decision by:

1. **Contacting the enforcement team** at [conduct@your-domain.com]
2. **Providing additional context** or information
3. **Requesting a review** of the decision
4. **Working with mediators** if necessary

Appeals will be reviewed by community leaders who were not involved in the original decision.
