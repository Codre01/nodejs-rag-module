# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of the Embedding Vector Database (RAG Module) with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |

| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email** security reports to: [olaoyepaulkolade@gmail.com]
3. **Include** the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment** within 48 hours of your report
- **Initial assessment** within 5 business days
- **Regular updates** on our progress
- **Credit** in our security advisory (if desired)

### Response Timeline

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Patch within 7 days
- **High severity**: Patch within 14 days
- **Medium/Low severity**: Patch within 30 days

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

#### Local Data Storage
- **SQLite databases** are stored locally on your filesystem
- **Embedding models** are loaded into local memory
- **No data** is transmitted to external services by default

#### MySQL Integration
- **Connection strings** should use environment variables
- **Database credentials** should never be hardcoded
- **SSL/TLS encryption** is recommended for production deployments

### Input Validation

The module implements comprehensive input validation:

```typescript
// Text input sanitization
request.text = InputValidator.sanitizeText(request.text);

// Table name validation (prevents SQL injection)
request.tablename = InputValidator.validateTableName(request.tablename);

// ID validation (ensures non-negative integers)
request.id = InputValidator.validateId(request.id);
```

### SQL Injection Prevention

- **Parameterized queries** are used throughout the codebase
- **Table names** are validated against a strict regex pattern
- **User input** is sanitized before database operations

### Model Security

#### Model File Integrity
- **Verify checksums** of downloaded embedding models
- **Use trusted sources** like Hugging Face for model downloads
- **Scan models** for malicious content if from untrusted sources

#### Memory Management
- **Models are disposed** properly when closing the module
- **Memory leaks** are prevented through proper resource cleanup
- **Singleton pattern** prevents multiple model instances

### Database Security

#### SQLite Security
- **File permissions** should be restricted to the application user
- **Database encryption** can be implemented using SQLCipher
- **Backup security** should be considered for sensitive data

#### MySQL Security
- **Use connection pooling** with proper limits
- **Implement proper authentication** and authorization
- **Enable SSL/TLS** for network connections
- **Regular security updates** for MySQL server

### Environment Security

#### Development Environment
```bash
# Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
export DB_HOST=localhost
export DB_USER=your_user
export DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
export MODEL_PATH=/secure/path/to/model.gguf
```

#### Production Environment
- **Use secrets management** systems (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- **Implement proper logging** without exposing sensitive data
- **Regular security audits** of dependencies
- **Container security** if using Docker

### Dependency Security

#### Regular Updates
```bash
# Check for security vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix automatically fixable vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# Update dependencies regularly
npm update
```

#### Known Vulnerabilities
- Monitor security advisories for dependencies
- Subscribe to security notifications for Node.js and npm
- Use tools like Snyk or GitHub Dependabot

### Best Practices

#### Configuration Security
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Use environment variables
const rag = new RAGModule({
  modelPath: process.env.MODEL_PATH,
  databasePath: process.env.DB_PATH,
  logLevel: process.env.LOG_LEVEL as LogLevel
});

// ❌ Bad: Hardcoded paths
const rag = new RAGModule({
  modelPath: '/home/user/secret-model.gguf',
  databasePath: '/var/db/sensitive-data.db'
});
```

#### Error Handling Security
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Generic error messages for users
catch (error) {
  logger.error('Database operation failed', { error: error.message });
  throw new RAGError('Operation failed', ErrorCodes.DATABASE_ERROR);
}

// ❌ Bad: Exposing internal details
catch (error) {
  throw new Error(`Database failed: ${error.stack}`);
}
```

#### Logging Security
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Log without sensitive data
logger.info('User search completed', { 
  userId: user.id, 
  resultCount: results.length 
});

// ❌ Bad: Logging sensitive information
logger.info('Search completed', { 
  query: sensitiveQuery, 
  userEmail: user.email 
});
```
